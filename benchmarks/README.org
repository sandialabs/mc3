#+TITLE: MC3 Benchmarking
#+AUTHOR: Blake C. Rawlings

This directory includes the material to run some benchmark problems
--- specifically, the ones from the 2015 Hardware Model Checking
Competition.  The actual benchmark problems themselves are very large,
and are not kept here; they can be downloaded from
[[http://fmv.jku.at/hwmcc15/]].  The benchmarks depend on AIGER and
NuSMV (refer to [[file:../README.org]]).

First, download the benchmarks and unpack them to the proper
directories (refer to [[Makefile]]).  Next, run =mc3= on each of the
benchmark problems and log the output:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make all
#+END_SRC
After that, summarize the results:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make summarize
#+END_SRC
If NuSMV is available, run it with various combinations of settings on
each of the problems that =mc3= solved:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make all-nusmv
#+END_SRC
and produce a table with the results:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make compare
#+END_SRC
